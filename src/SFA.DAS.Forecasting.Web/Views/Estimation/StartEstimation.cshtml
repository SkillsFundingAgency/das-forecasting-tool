                    <p>This tool is designed to illustrate what your funds may look like based on the apprenticeships currently in your apprenticeship service account and the funding band maximum for the estimated apprenticeships you have added, using this estimator.</p>
                    <p>The actual amount of funds available is likely to vary if there are any changes made to your apprenticeship arrangements, including, for example, changes in the number of apprentices employed, or the cost and duration of their training. </p>
                    <p>You should therefore not rely solely on the information provided by this tool when making decisions about the transfer of funds.</p>
